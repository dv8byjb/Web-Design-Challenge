Weather and Latitude
The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities. This https://dv8byjb.github.io/KeturahB.github.io/index.html provides the data and visualizations created as part of the analyis. The visualizations include Maxt Temperature, Cloudiness, Wind Speed and humidity plots.
